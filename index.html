I will always remember The day you kissed my lips Light as a feather And it went just like this No, it's never been better Than the summer of 2002
  We were only eleven But acting like grownups Like we are in the present
  Drinking from plastic cups Singing love is forever and ever Well, I guess that was true Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods On an old Mustang, where we sang Songs with all our childhoods friends And it went like this, say Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me Better hit me, baby, one more time Paint a picture for you and me Of the days when we were young Singing at the top of both our lungs Now we're under the covers Fast forward to eighteen We are more than lovers Yeah, we are all we need When we're holding each other I'm taken back to 2002(p태그는 정보로서 좀 더 가치있게 표현할 수 있음)</p>
